This is an experimental VDPAU implementation for sunxi SoCs.

Most features of full VDPAU are missing, only decoding of h264, mpeg1 and mpeg2
will work. Output is not integrated into window system but rather overlays it.
Only tested with mplayer, if other players need unimplemented functions something
will fail.

   $ make
   $ make install

   $ export VDPAU_DRIVER=sunxi
   $ mplayer -vo vdpau -vc ffmpeg12vdpau,ffh264vdpau [filename]
