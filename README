This is an experimental VDPAU implementation for sunxi SoCs.

Most features of full VDPAU are missing, only decoding of h264, mpeg1 and
mpeg2 and output of software-decoded videos will work.
Output bypasses X video driver, hence don't try to use Xv
at the same time.
Only tested with mplayer, if other players need unimplemented functions
something will fail.

   $ make
   $ make install

   $ export VDPAU_DRIVER=sunxi
   $ mplayer -vo vdpau -vc ffmpeg12vdpau,ffh264vdpau, [filename]
